## 1. PURPOSE OF DOCUMENTATION

This repository and all associated documentation (including but not limited to the Ploutus-D analysis, forensic artifacts, and mitigation protocols) are provided for **strictly educational, research, and authorized security auditing purposes**. The primary objective is to enhance the global cybersecurity posture by providing a deterministic, transparent, and accurate analysis of ATM jackpotting methodologies.

## 2. LEGAL NOTICE (INTERNATIONAL LAW)

Unauthorized access to computer systems, including ATMs (Automated Teller Machines), is a serious criminal offense. Users of this information are reminded that:

* **18 U.S.C. § 1030 (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act):** Prohibits unauthorized access to "protected computers."
* **Budapest Convention on Cybercrime:** International standards regarding illegal access and system interference.
* **Local Statutes:** Most jurisdictions carry severe penalties (including long-term imprisonment and massive fines) for the deployment of malware or hardware manipulation on financial infrastructure.

**SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA** and the contributors to this repository do not condone, encourage, or support any illegal activities. Any use of the techniques described herein for malicious purposes is the sole responsibility of the end-user.

## 3. "RED TEAMING" & AUTHORIZATION

Testing of these forensic concepts on physical ATM hardware (Diebold, KAL, etc.) must **ONLY** be conducted under the following conditions:

1. **Written Authorization:** A formal Statement of Work (SOW) and a signed Liability Waiver from the legal owner of the hardware.
2. **Isolated Environment:** Hardware must be disconnected from any production banking networks or interbank switches (e.g., Cirrus, PLUS).
3. **Non-Production Assets:** Only "Retired" or "Lab-only" ATM units should be used to prevent accidental financial loss or data corruption.

## 4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

The information provided is **100% ACCURATE** based on reverse-engineered samples (MD5 verified against the 2025 "Tren de Aragua" campaign). However:

* **NO WARRANTY:** This data is provided "AS-IS" without any warranty of any kind, express or implied.
* **NO LIABILITY:** Under no circumstances shall the author (**SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA**) be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, loss of funds, hardware bricking, or legal prosecution) arising from the use or misuse of this information.

## 5. REVERSE ENGINEERING ETHICS

The binaries described (e.g., `Diebold.exe`, `AgilisConfigurationUtility.exe`) are analyzed for the purpose of **Interoperability and Security Defense** only. This analysis aims to empower forensic investigators to detect, identify, and neutralize Ploutus-D variants in the field.

## 6. TERMINATION OF ACCESS

By accessing, cloning, or forking this repository, you (the "User") acknowledge that you have read this disclaimer and agree to be bound by its terms. If you do not agree, you are commanded to delete all local copies and cease access immediately.
