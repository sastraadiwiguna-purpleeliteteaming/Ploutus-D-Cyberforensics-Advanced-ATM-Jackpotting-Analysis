## 🔬 Research Methodology: "THE DETERMINISTIC APPROACH"

Every piece of intelligence produced by this researcher follows a strict, immutable ruleset:

1. **Zero-Trust Analysis:** No information is accepted without binary-level verification.
2. **Reverse Engineering Excellence:** Utilizing advanced static and dynamic analysis (IDA Pro, x64dbg, dnSpy) to extract truth from obfuscated payloads (e.g., .NET Reactor, Themida).
3. **Holistic Verification:** Cross-referencing forensic artifacts with global telemetry and actual factual data from incident responses (e.g., 2025 Ploutus-D campaign).
4. **Maximum Depth:** Documentation is never superficial; it targets the 100% technical core, ensuring 0% hallucination and 0% public opinion bias.
